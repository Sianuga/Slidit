Slidit is casual game, where with the use of sensors you eliminate the enemies (bats) and avoid the bombs for as long as you can survive.

Controls:
- Right/left rotation controls the movement of the flame
- Forward/backward tilt controls the state of the flame, forward is to light the flame and backward is to extuinguish

When you extinguish the flame you do not hit anything, neither bombs nor bats, so it is a safe state, but to score you need to light the flame up and risk hitting the bottom. 
Otherwise bats will reach the player and ultimately end the game if one does not do it by activating the bombs by a mistake.
